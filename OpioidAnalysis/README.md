## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Between 1999 and 2016, more than 630,000 people died from a drug overdose in the United States. The current epidemic of drug overdoses began in the 1990s with overdose deaths involving prescription opioids, driven by dramatic increases in prescribing of opioids for chronic pain.  

We will analyze data for 5 years (2013 to 2017) to understand the **opioid prescription rates of health care providers** based on their speciality and the death rates due to opioid addiction.  

We will aslo study the impact of **Socioeconomic indicators** like poverty rates, population change, unemployment rates, and education levels on opioid addiction

Based on definition of our problem, data that we need:
* opioid drug prescriptions by doctors by speccialtiy

* [Socioeconomic Indicator Database!](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/)
